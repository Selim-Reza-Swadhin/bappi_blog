Computer Learning Center is a sixteen-year old Educational Institute.  We offer basic computer training, in the form of our Career Enhancement Program (CEP) and Professional Certifications such as Graphics design, videoediting, and Web Page.   Whether you are looking for a career change, a new job, a promotion or to update your skills in the workplace, we have the program you need.  No matter which career path you choose, students have their own computer to work on in class and practice time is FREE and UNLIMITED.   Job placement assistance is included with all of our courses.  We have flexible hours such as days, evenings, and weekends to fit your busy schedule.  We offer financing through several lenders for all our courses subject to qualification.
For those students interested in training on a specific application, but don't wish to take a course, there is one-on-one instruction available.  Rates vary depending on the subject matter and schedules are flexible in order to meet your busy work commitments.  For information and rates please email  or Contact us describing your requirements.
Corporate training is also available either at the Center or at your site.  If training requirements do not fit our standard course curricula, we will design programs in concert with your company.  Rates vary depending on the subject matter.  
For those companies that have trainers on staff, the Center will rent classrooms with networked PCs, Internet access, assorted audio-visual teaching aids,  and full break room facilities at competitive rates.  For a quote, email your request.
